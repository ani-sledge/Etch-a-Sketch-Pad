# Etch-a-Sketch-Pad
A dynamic sketchpad with adjustable pixel sizes and pen colors.
This was a response to the [jQuery project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery) suggested by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home). 
The desired 'grid width' can be changed by entering a number into an input field at the top of the page, and clicking the refresh button.
The color can be selected from clicking on a palette of basic colors.
As you hover over each pixel, it's opacity increases by 0.1, and the color changes to the current color.
